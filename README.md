SWAYAM - Be your own doctor

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:**
The aim of this project is to develop a Smart medical report which will analyze a medical test report and generate the concerns and give a health advisory.

**CONCLUSION:**
A smart medical report generated at home through a blood test, by entering correct details using Python and a Graphical User Interface (GUI), provides a convenient and efficient way for individuals to monitor their health. By leveraging Python's analytical capabilities and a user-friendly GUI, this system empowers users to access personalized medical insights, aiding in early detection and proactive management of health conditions, all from the comfort of their homes. This technological advancement has the potential to revolutionize healthcare delivery, promoting preventive care and empowering individuals to take control of their well-being.
